            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>During the game, the players take gems and gold. With these gems they can purchase development cards which are worth prestige points and bonuses. These bonuses allow players to purchase subsequent development cards for a lesser cost. When a player has enough bonuses they may receive a visit from a noble (which is also worth prestige points). Nobles will also bring armies with them that allow players to attack others that have a noble on their side. As soon as a player reaches 25 prestige points, the current turn ends and the player with the most prestige points is declared the winner.</p>

                <p>A player can never have more than 100 gems, at the end of their turn. 20 gems of the same color could not be taken if there are less than 40 gems available of that color.</p>

            <h2>Development Cards</h2>
            <section class="subsection-whole">
                <h3>Explanation</h3>
                <p>To win prestige points, players must purchase development cards. These cards are visible in the middle of the screen and may be purchased by all players during the game on their turn. When purchased the development card will stay at the player's hand throughout the game. The owned development gives a player a bonus of a single gem displayed on the card.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="subsection-half">
                <h3>Purchasing</h3>
                <p>Every development card has a displayed price for the amount of gems required to purchase that card. If a player has the funds to purchase the development card they may use their turn to purchase a development card.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="subsection-half">
                <h3>Reserving</h3>
                <p>If a player has an interest in a development card they could not currently afford they may take a turn to reserve it. Each player could reserve a max of one card at a time. When reserving a card a player also takes a gold coin. The gold coin could be used as any gem that the player desires.</p>

            <h2>Nobles</h2>
            <section class="subsection-half">
                <h3>Explanation</h3>
                <p>Rich nobles will be attracted to the player if they have the correct amount of development cards worth the gem that a noble requires. Attracting a noble will take a player turn but will not have any cost to the player. The player attracting the noble gets to keep the cards that are required to attract the noble.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="subsection-half">
                <h3>Attacking</h3>
                <p>With a noble on your side you now have the ability to take a turn to attack another noble. In this turn another player's noble is selected to attack. Attacks use the noble's prestige points amount as an attack value. In the attack both nobles involved will come out with less worth in their points. The victim's noble points will be their noble points minus the attacker's noble points. The attacker's noble points will be the absolute value of the difference between the two nobles. If a noble reaches 0 or less prestige points they will be removed from the player and set aside.</p>
